<h2>Shu's top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Pride & Prejudice</h3>
<p>Movie of a classic story with great costume pieces of the olden era!</p>

<h3>Marvel movies</h3>
<p>nothing in particular but these are great to watch on the big screen and a genre of movies that i've grown to appreciate in the later years</p>

<h3>Chick flicks</h3>
<p>again nothing in particular but I do love my light hearted rom coms and chick flicks that are brainless and these really made up my growing up teenage years</p>
